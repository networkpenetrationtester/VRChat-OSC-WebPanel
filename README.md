Goofy dynamically generated webpage expressions menu for VRChat using OSC.

Barebones HTML, no CSS, needs major code refactoring.

Edit config.json as always (why don't I just use envfiles ? idk lmao I was raised on 'config.xml' and that's the way its gonna stay.)

This program is meant to be run whilst VRChat is open. Enable OSC through the expressions menu, whilst the interface.js is running.

Open a web browser to http://localhost:<CONFIG.HTTP_PORT>/interface, and you should be able to see the expressions menu as sliders and buttons.

The values *should* bi-directionally update in realtime.
